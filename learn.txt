Why Automate ML Training?
When I started learning ML, data scientists just ran training scripts manually on their laptops.
This doesn't scale and creates the classic "works on my machine" problem different Python versions, 
libraries, and environments everywhere.

How CI/CD Fixes This
With GitHub Actions (or Jenkins), you set automation rules:

Push code → training runs automatically
Merge PR → model retrains
Data updates → new training starts

Training happens consistently in the same environment every time.


Key Benefits
Clean slate every run No cached files or forgotten dependencies
Everything tracked Every model tied to a Git commit, so you always know what code created it
Fails fast Broken dependencies or bad data? You find out immediately, not in production
No manual work No more emailing model files or remembering to run scripts
Bottom Line
You stop depending on someone's laptop and manual steps. 
Training becomes predictable and repeatable that's the foundation of MLOps.
